The source codes include f1 (shpere function), f2 (Rosenbrock function), f3 (Rastrigrin function), f4 (Griewank function), f5 (Ackey function), f6(shaffer's function), f7 (Schefewl function) and QPSO source code. The source code of QPSO utilizes many matrix operation, particularly for the loop of updating the particle's position on each dimension.
